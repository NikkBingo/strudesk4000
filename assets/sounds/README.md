# Audio Files

Place your pre-recorded audio files (MP3, WAV, etc.) in this directory.

The application is configured to load audio files from here. Update the paths in `src/config.js` to match your audio file names.

Example audio file paths in config:
- `/assets/sounds/sample1.mp3`
- `/assets/sounds/sample2.mp3`

Note: Audio files are optional. The application also supports synthesized sounds without requiring any audio files.
